What I created for the final project. It is a game where the player competes against three other bots in a dungeon-maze-like map to hog a position—the middle of the map—for as long as possible. The game ends when one player has done this for a certain duration of time. To aid your efforts, you are allowed to shoot bullets that knock back the enemies. There are also buffs that can be picked up to improve various stats such as shooting speed, armor, and movement speed. 

You are allowed to choose between different maps—or just a randomly created one—and different characters (each with different abilities).

| Character | Abilities |
| --------  | --------- |
| Knight | Increased armor (lowers knockback) |
| Rogue | Increased movement speed |
| Paladin | Increased shooting speed |

## Instructions
